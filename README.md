# Sarcastic-Headline-Detector

The Model is designed to build and evaluate a machine learning model for detecting sarcasm in textual data. This notebook includes a comprehensive workflow starting from data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, to building a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used comprises headlines from various news articles labeled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The model leverages NLP techniques and neural networks, including LSTM and word embeddings, to understand the nuances of sarcastic versus sincere text. This repository provides all the necessary code and documentation to replicate the model, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in the field of natural language processing and sarcasm detection.
